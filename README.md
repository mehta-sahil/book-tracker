# Book Tracker

This is a small project I built out of curiosity and as a hobby to practice the MERN stack.  
I wanted to learn how CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations work in a real-world app, so I decided to make something simple and useful: a book tracker.  

The app lets you keep track of books you want to read, are currently reading, or have finished. You can also add details like the author, notes, and a rating.
